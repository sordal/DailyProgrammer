# Description

The IUPAC Periodic Table of the Elements is one of the most recognizable features of modern chemistry - the organization of all known chemical elements along with some of their most fundamental properties, together with their names and symbols. Today we're going to use that as we spell some words.
Here's the list of the elements alphabetized by the element's name. We can also see the symbol (1 or 2 letters - we're omitting the emerging elements that often contain three letters), atomic number and weight, and Pauling Electronegativities (c), which are unused in this challenge. See Data .csv
